    <h1>Imports / exports to and from non-EU countries</h1>

    <p>Since the 80s the Firm is very attentive to customs problems. 
      Many, in fact, are the issues that can affect a commercial 
      operator, and that, therefore, deserve special analysis, 
      preferably preventive.
    </p>

    <p>For example: </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="LcustomTranslation" id="L6">request the proper 
        tariff classification of imported goods (which determines 
        the level of imposition of customs duties and/or the 
        existence of any prohibitions or restrictions on imports);
      </li>

      <li>use within the rules  customs & warehouses VAT (especially 
        in the free zones); 
      </li>

      <li class="LcustomTranslation" id="L7">legally process goods 
        under suspension of duties.
      </li>
    </ul>
