    <h1>EXTRAJUDICIAL  RESOLUTION Of NATIONAL, EU &amp; 
      INTERNATIONAL disputes</h1>

    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L62">The Firm provides 
      assistance and representation in procedures (formal or informal) 
      aimed at resolving disputes or preventing disputes from arising, 
      both between private entities or with public authorities. 
    </p>

    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L63"> At all levels (national 
      and international), the Firm offers assistance with the 
      following types of proceedings:  arbitration proceedings 
      (both formal and amicable), conciliation, and mediation 
      (also in the tax area).
    </p>

    <p>At the Community level:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> administrative contacts with institutions or bodies 
        of the European Union - especially the European Commission 
        - seeking the settlement of an issue (in any sector covered 
        by Community legislation);
      </li>
      <br>
      <li> administrative proceedings - and, where appropriate, 
        conciliation or arbitration - in accordance with European 
        Union legislation in certain sectors, especially those in 
        procurement of goods or services in third countries
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Internationally, the Firm provides assistance in various 
      areas including the procedures of the International Chamber 
      of Commerce (ICC). 
    </p>

    <h4>Cases</h4>
    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L64">To give an idea of the 
      type of extrajudicial proceedings supported by the Firm at 
      the supranational level, we list:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>in a case of alleged breach of contract the company won 
        a tender issued by the European Union Delegation in an 
        African state for the renovation of the water supply of the 
        capital of the State (the complaint was that it provided, 
        in part, goods of Chinese origin rather than - as deemed
        mandatory - Community or ACP goods);
      </li> 
      <br>
      <li>dispute arose between the parties to a contract of 
        international agency in regards to the indemnity and 
        severance payment claimed by the  French agent. The dispute 
        was referred to arbitration conducted by the International 
        Chamber of Commerce in Paris (ICC).

    </ul>
