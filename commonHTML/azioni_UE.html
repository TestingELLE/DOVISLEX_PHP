        <h1 class="news LcustomTranslation" id="S81">Legal actions based on EU Law</h1>
        <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L39">European Union Law (or 
            Community Law, as the term that was used prior to the Lisbon 
            Treaty which entered into force on 1 December 2009) is 
            applicable to all natural and legal persons, even those who 
            live / work exclusively within their  national borders.
        </p>

        <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L40">Indeed, EU Law not 
            only applies to international relations (intra and extra EU), 
            but also has an influence on many branches of Law (either 
            by direct applicability or because the Law of a Member State 
            must conform to it).
        </p>

        <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L41">EU Law may be invoked 
            by all those who have an interest, through multiple avenues 
            and jurisdictions.

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="S82">Since EU Law is applicable in the Member States, any dispute about the interpretation or validity must be raised before the national courts.</p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L42">Indeed, the national 
                    courts must apply EU Law and, if they have doubts about 
                    its interpretation or its validity, may -- and sometimes 
                    must -- refer to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg for 
                    a preliminary ruling.

            <div class="extra-info" id="collapseB" style="display:none">
                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L43">The responsibility 
                    to apply EU Law and to enforce it, if necessary in 
                    cooperation with the Court of Justice of the European 
                    Union based in Luxembourg, rests in first instance on 
                    the national courts.
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L44">In fact, the national 
                    court called to decide on a matter (civil, criminal, 
                    administrative or tax) whose outcome depends on a EU 
                    rule/principle of Law can or should (as appropriate) 
                    stay the proceedings to refer to the Court of Justice 
                    a preliminary question on the correct interpretation or 
                    validity of that rule/principle in accordance with 
                    Article 267 TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the 
                    European Union)
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L45">The reference to 
                    the Court of Justice is a very important instrument of 
                    cooperation between national courts and the Court of 
                    Justice, as it provides to the former - for example - 
                    an interpretation of EU Law needed to resolve disputes 
                    before those courts (in cases - for instance - where both 
                    parties have relied on EU Law, but interpreting it in 
                    different ways, or where one party has invoked EU Law and 
                    the other national Law).
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L46">Although the 
                    reference ruling can only be initiated by decision of 
                    the national judge in the case, it is often highly 
                    advisable that one or the parties to the case urge 
                    the activation of this instrument.
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L47">During such a procedure, 
                    the parties to the national case have the right to submit 
                    (written and/or oral) observations to the Court of Justice. 
                    Thus, they have the opportunity to play an active role to 
                    try to induce the European Court to provide an 
                    interpretation (or a judgment on the validity) of 
                    Community rules favorable to their thesis.
                </p>

                <p>Therefore, this is a tool that may prove decisive for 
                    the protection of the clients of the Firm.

        <div class="more">
            <button id="pairE" data-href="#collapseE" class="nav-toggle notranslate" onclick="plus(this)">&raquo; plus</button>

            <div class="extra-info" id="collapseE" style="display:none">
                <p>The Firm also regularly prepares, files and represents 
                    complaints  to the European Commission in various sectors.
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L51">A complaint does not 
                    obviate the need, if any (also in order to avoid 
                    prescriptions or forfeitures), to bring forth a planned 
                    legal action at the national level; however, it can be 
                    a "strategic"  tool for the purpose of better protection 
                    of the clients of the Firm.
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L52">In fact, a complaint 
                    can - if it appears well-founded - lead the Commission to 
                    pressure (if necessary, through the opening of formal 
                    "infringement proceedings" pursuant to Article 258 TFEU) 
                    the competent national authorities (central or local ) 
                    to amend the legislation or internal administrative 
                    practices considered contrary to the Community 
                    legislation or jurisprudence.
                </p>

                <p>A complaint may also be directed to the case Law of 
                    national courts (especially to that of the higher courts) 
                    if contrary to European Law.
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L53">Complaints in 
                    competition matters (antitrust and State aid) are subject 
                    to special rules in terms of procedure and may lead, if 
                    they are deemed well-founded, to decisions of the European 
                    Commission to sanction or impose fines against the 
                    companies complained of.
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="S85">Regardless of the industry, the complaint - sometimes - 
                    allows you to deposit as part of a national cause any 
                    pending notices - if favorable - that the European 
                    Commission shall provide the entity complainant.
                </p>

                <p>Therefore, this is a tool that may prove decisive for 
                    the protection of clients of the Firm.
                </p>


                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L54">By way of example, 
                    and limited to the past five years, the Firm has filed

                    European Ombudsman (in accordance with Article 228 TFEU) 
                    who investigates complaints about maladministration 
                    involving institutions and bodies of the European Union.
                </p>

                <p>Who can complain to the European Ombudsman?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>nationals of a Member State of the European Union

                </ul>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L60">As with other types 
                    of complaints, a complaint to the European Ombudsman - 
                    it is well to stress - does not obviate the necessity 
                    to initiate possible legal actions before the Tribunal 
                    of the European Union.
                </p>

                <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L61">However, sometimes, 
                    it can be a useful alternative to other legal proceedings, 
                    as the European Ombudsman may decide to encourage amicable 
                    solutions that satisfy both the complainant and the 
                    institution.
