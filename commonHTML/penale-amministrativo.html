        <h1 class="LcustomTranslation" id="F62">Customs &  Criminal/administrative offenses related to Community fraud</h1>

        <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="F63">The Firm follows (directly or in association with criminal 
            lawyers) criminal and administrative proceedings in Italy for
            alleged "Community fraud", where the commercial operator is 
            accused to have  illegally received EU funding or to have evaded 
            the payment of customs duties. In fact, in all these cases, 
            the question depends on the correct interpretation of European 
            legislation.
